# Desktop Orbits
Desktop Orbits turns your desktop into a simulation of planets (your icons) dancing and orbiting around each other.

## Features
- Totally coded in C++ :)
- Currently there is only Windows 10 support (I hope it works on other Win 10 devices)
- Pseudo-normal-like orbits around a center icon


## Tech
This project uses the following public code:

- [nlohmann/json] - C++ json cappabilities
- [Vec2] - C++ vectorial simple class
- [polarCoords2] - C++ polar form vectors simple class

## Installation
Unlock desktop icons. [Quick tutorial if you don't know how]

Download the *_READY.zip file on the version release of your choice.
Unzip the file and execute the executable.

## Config
You can tinker with the configuration as you wish but it can maybe mess you icons a little bit.

## License
