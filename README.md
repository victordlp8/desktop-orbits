# Desktop Orbits
Desktop Orbits turns your desktop into a simulation of planets (your icons) dancing and orbiting around each other.

## Features
- Totally coded in C++ :)
- Currently there is only Windows 10 support (I hope it works on other Win 10 devices)
- Pseudo-normal-like orbits around a center icon


## Tech
This project uses the following public code:

- [nlohmann/json] - C++ json cappabilities
- [vector_2D] - C++ vectorial simple class
- [polarForm_2D] - C++ polar form vectors simple class
- [movingEntity_2D] - C++ moving entities simple class

## Installation
1. Unlock desktop icons. [Quick tutorial if you don't know how]
2. Download the *_READY.zip file on the version release of your choice. [Here are all the releases]
3. Unzip the file and execute the executable.

Your central icon may not be in the center of your main screen, you can modify the 'offset' parameter in the config file to get it to wherever you want it.
Remember that the top left corner of your most top left screen is coordinates (0, 0) increasing as you move away from that point.

## Config
You can tinker with the configuration as you wish but it can maybe mess your icons behavior a little bit.
